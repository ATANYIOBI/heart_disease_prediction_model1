In this project, i analyze heart disease 1032 entries and 15 attributes of dataset, explore major factors contributing to the disease through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization tools such as seaborn and matplotlib,
Training the model using the three differenet  Machine Leaning algorithms in which RandomForest outperformed other two classifiers. the dataset was divided into training set(80%) and testing set(20%).
making predictions with testing set and finally 
evaluating the model with evualtion metries such as; precision(1.0), accuracy(1.0), and recall(1.0).
